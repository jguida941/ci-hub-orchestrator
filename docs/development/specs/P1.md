# P1 Requirements (Should-Have)

These requirements should be met for a complete v1.0 release.

---

## 1. Architecture Decision Records

- [ ] `docs/adr/` directory exists
- [ ] ADR-0001: Central vs Distributed as default mode
- [ ] ADR-0002: Config precedence hierarchy
- [ ] ADR-0003: Reusable workflows vs workflow_dispatch
- [ ] ADR-0004: Aggregation strategy (same-run vs polling)
- [ ] ADR-0005: Dashboard approach (GitHub Pages vs Grafana)

---

## 2. Extended Documentation

- [x] `docs/guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - common failures and fixes
- [x] `docs/guides/TEMPLATES.md` - list of templates and when to use
- [ ] All tools have detailed documentation in TOOLS.md
- [ ] Config examples for common scenarios

---

## 3. Profile Templates

- [ ] `templates/profiles/java-quality.yml` (JaCoCo, Checkstyle, SpotBugs)
- [ ] `templates/profiles/java-security.yml` (OWASP, CodeQL, Semgrep)
- [ ] `templates/profiles/python-quality.yml` (pytest, Ruff, Black, mypy)
- [ ] `templates/profiles/python-security.yml` (Bandit, pip-audit, CodeQL)

---

## 4. Dashboard

- [ ] GitHub Pages site configured
- [ ] `hub-report.json` committed to gh-pages branch
- [ ] Static HTML/JS reads JSON and renders charts
- [ ] Overview page with all repos
- [ ] Drill-down per repo
- [ ] Historical trend data (optional)

---

## 5. Sandbox/Fixture Repos

- [ ] `fixtures/java-passing/` - Java repo that should pass
- [ ] `fixtures/java-failing/` - Java repo that should fail
- [ ] `fixtures/python-passing/` - Python repo that should pass
- [ ] `fixtures/python-failing/` - Python repo that should fail
- [ ] Hub CI tests against fixtures on every push

---

## 6. CLI Tool

- [ ] `hub-cli repo add` - interactive or flag-based
- [ ] `hub-cli repo list` - list configured repos
- [ ] `hub-cli config lint` - validate all configs
- [ ] `hub-cli profile apply` - apply preset profile
- [ ] `--dry-run` flag for preview
- [ ] pip-installable package

---

## 7. Distributed Mode Polish

- [ ] `templates/repo-agent/.github/workflows/hub-agent.yml`
- [ ] Correlation ID for tracking dispatched runs
- [ ] Poll for completion with timeout
- [ ] Download artifacts from completed runs
- [ ] Merge results into unified report

---

## Acceptance Criteria

**P1 is COMPLETE when:**
1. All checkboxes above are `[x]`
2. ADRs document key decisions
3. Dashboard shows real metrics
4. CLI allows easy repo onboarding
5. Fixtures validate hub behavior

## Status Legend
- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[~]` - In progress
- `[x]` - Verified complete
- `[!]` - Blocked

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-14
