# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Decisions that change architecture, security posture, or documentation governance are captured here. Use sequential numbering (`0001-*.md`) and keep entries concise: Context → Decision → Consequences → Status → References.

Process:
1. Copy the template below when adding a new ADR.
2. Mark `Status` as Proposed until reviewed; move to Accepted when committed.
3. Link related issues/PRs and mainline docs (plan, status, README).

Template:
```
# ADR-0000: Title
Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded

Owners: @github-handle

## Context
<Why this decision is needed>

## Decision
<The decision and scope>

## Consequences
- <Impact 1>

## References

```
