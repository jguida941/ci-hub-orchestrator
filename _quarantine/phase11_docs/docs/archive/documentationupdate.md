# Documentation Upgrade (Deprecated)

This planning note has been superseded by:
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` (how to update docs)
- `docs/OVERVIEW.md` and `docs/TESTING.md` (structure and navigation)
- ADR-0003 (`docs/adr/0003-docs-governance.md`) for documentation governance

Future documentation updates should follow those sources of truth. Do not add new guidance here.
